                <h1>AFA Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

                <h3>Payment</h3>
                <p>Fees are payable in advance. It is a basic condition of attendance that fees are payable during the registration day, or at the ground canteen if available.</p>
                <p>Students should not attend classes if fees are not paid, unless prior agreement with a FFD staff member has been made.</p>
                <h3>Dress Code</h3>
                <p>Please send your child in either purchased FFD kit or standard football gear, with appropriate shin pads and footwear: Joggers/Trainers, Indoor or football boots (depending on the surface) and water bottle with at least 600ml of hydration.</p>
                <p>Jewelry CANNOT be worn as they may be torn from the body causing physical damage.</p>
                <h3>Note:</strong> During Summer Months, as the temperature rises we kindly ask that all students wear a hat and sunscreen.</p>
                <h3>Attendance</h3>
                <p>Please ensure your child is punctual in his/her attendance at all training classes (at least 10mins prior to the start time). If your child is late he/she may be asked to sit at the side of the session until the trainer/group has finished
                    their current practice.</p>
                <p>Please ensure an FFD staff member is present at the venue before leaving your child for his/her class.</p>
                <h3>During Class</h3>
                <p>Parents/Guardians and siblings are NOT to enter the field of play at ANY time during the class. Please keep to a safe distance away from the training area. Persistent offenders may be asked to leave the site and their child may be asked
                    to leave the Development Sessions without a refund.</p>
                <h3>Personal Behavior</h3>
                <p>The student must respect the trainer and other attendees in the class. In the case of bad language, violence, ignorant conduct and behavior that prevents the class from proceeding, the trainer reserves the right to remove the student from
                    the class. If the student does not comply, the trainer may, in his/her discretion, terminate the student&rsquo;s training class.</p>
                <h3>Collection</h3>
                <p>Your child must be collected from the playing area. If you wish for your child to be collected by a different person, please inform FFD staff of who that person shall be.</p>
                <p>If your child is collected more than 10 minutes late on several occasions, he/she may be asked to leave the Development Sessions &ndash; No refund shall be given.</p>
                <h3>Illness</h3>
                <p>If your child is ill and cannot attend a class, FFD must be notified asap via SMS/Email before the session starts. FFD will attempt to provide make up classes on a predefined venue/day. However, this will only be done on a best effort
                    basis.</p>
                <h3>Refunds</h3>
                <p>Refunds shall not be given if a class is cancelled outside of FFD&rsquo;s control &ndash; e.g. Extreme weather. Refunds shall not be given to those people who choose to go on holiday during term time.</p>

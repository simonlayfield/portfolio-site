                <h3>Payment</h3>
                <p>Fees are payable in advance. It is a basic condition of attendance that fees are payable during the registration day.</p>
                <p>Players should not attend future classes if fees are not paid, unless prior agreement with an Advanced Football Academy staff member has been made.</p>
                <h3>Dress Code</h3>
                <p>Please send your child to training sessions with the standard football gear, with appropriate footwear: football boots, football shin pads, soccer ball and water bottle. Joggers and snickers are not allowed and shin pads must be worn at all times for the protection of players. There is a &ldquo;no shin pad no play&rdquo; policy in place.</p>

                <p>Please ensure your child is punctual in his/her attendance at all training classes (at least 10mins prior to the start time). If your child is late he/she may be asked to sit at the side of the session until the trainer/group has finished their current practice.</p>
